  Our project aims to create an engaging 2D platformer that enhances reading and comprehension skills, as well as integrates learning into games. With this approach, players can develop abilities that help them in everyday life through gaming, not the other way around.

## Guide
### Movements
- To control Celana, use the '**A**/**D**' keys to move her sideways, and '**Spacebar**' to make her jump over obstacles and platforms. With the additional '**S**' key for crouching through tight spaces.
